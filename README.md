"He who learns but does not think, is **lost.**"

### Hey there!

I'm Roy, an aspiring CS student based in Ontario.

My main stack right now is **Python, React, and Tailwind**, and currently learning **Pytorch, C++, and REST API**. I spend a lot of time in VS Code, reading docs, Leetcoding, and debugging things until they work.

If you’re curious about how I build, feel free to check out my projects or reach out!
